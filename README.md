# SADA
SADA is an agentic AI platform designed to help businesses identify user friction before launching products or services. Instead of relying on post-launch analytics, customer complaints, or reactive UX fixes, SADA simulates thousands of human experiences to understand how real users feel, behave, and fail when interacting with a product.
