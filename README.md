# SADA
SADA is an agentic AI platform designed to help businesses identify user friction before launching products or services. Instead of relying on post-launch analytics, customer complaints, or reactive UX fixes, SADA simulates thousands of human experiences to understand how real users feel, behave, and fail when interacting with a product.

🚀 Project SADA — The Human Experience Simulator

SADA is an agentic AI platform designed to help businesses proactively identify user friction before launching products or services. Instead of relying on post-launch analytics, customer complaints, or reactive UX fixes, SADA simulates thousands of human experiences to understand how real users feel, behave, and fail when interacting with a product.

Modern products often fail not because they are technically broken, but because they introduce small, invisible frictions like accessibility gaps, cognitive overload, unclear flows, cultural mismatches, or emotional stress. These issues only surface after launch, when businesses lose users, revenue, and trust. SADA shifts this process left by allowing teams to test human experience at scale before real users are impacted.


How It Works:

SADA operates through a four-agent pipeline that models the full human experience lifecycle:
	1.	Company Builder
Enriches business context using market and industry data to ground simulations in reality.
	2.	Population Generator
Creates diverse human personas across age, ability, language, stress level, environment, and accessibility needs.
	3.	Agentic Simulation Pipeline
	•	Agent I — Life-Weaver: Generates realistic, high-friction user scenarios.
	•	Agent II — Sentiment Extractor: Identifies emotional and cognitive responses.
	•	Agent III — Root-Seeker: Traces emotional friction back to system-level causes.
	•	Agent IV — Systemic Harmonizer: Proposes scalable, root-cause solutions.
	4.	Actionable Output
The system produces clear, explainable recommendations that improve usability, accessibility, and overall human experience, before launch.

💡 Why SADA Matters

SADA transforms user research from a reactive process into a proactive system. Businesses no longer need to wait for negative reviews or drop-off metrics to understand what went wrong. Instead, they can simulate how humans experience their product and fix issues before launch, saving time, money, and trust.

We don’t simulate system performance.
We simulate human experience.
